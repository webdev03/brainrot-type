(This website also has a really ~~bad~~ amazing AI chatbot.)

## How To Deploy

This site uses the SvelteKit Vercel adapter. You can change it in `svelte.config.js` and add the required package if needed, and deploy it with the instructions for your adapter.

You will also need a HuggingFace access token if you want to be able to use the AI chatbot, put it in the `.env` file following the `.env.example` template.
