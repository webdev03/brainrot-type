# Notes

Here you can see the notes that Devarsh and Luke wrote during the project!

## Thinking of Ideas

- "BrainRot Type" - Kind of like MonkeyType, but it will randomly make you make typos, will change the words _while you are typing_, and the prompts can be very evil
- "Very Normal Chess" - It's Chess but all moves are allowed to all positions (except if it checks the King, then it must follow the rules). Also add some bugs and allow players to change the theme of pieces.
- ~~"BrainRot Cards" - Kind of like Uno, but the card distribution is incredibly rigged, and you cannot win (if you outsmart the system we crash the game :D)~~

We decided to work on BrainRot Type first, then if it's fun, we'll keep it, otherwise work on another idea like Very Normal Chess
